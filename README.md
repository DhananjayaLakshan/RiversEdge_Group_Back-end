<h1><b>Food and Hospitality Management System</b></h1>
<p> 
  This is an academic project in Year 2 Semester 2. I use React and Bootstrap to build the Front-end. Node and Express JS are used to code the Backend of the project. I used MongoDB as the database of this web application. This system has 8 management systems,   
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Room Booking Management System</li>
  <li>Event Booking Management System</li>
  <li>Customer Management System</li>
  <li>Employee Management System</li>
  <li>Food and Beverage Management System</li>
  <li>Order Management System</li>
  <li>Utility Bill Management System</li>
  <li>Inventory Management System</li>  
</ul>  
<p>In this system customers can handle their profile activities. Once they register to the system they can search rooms, and filter rooms by room type then, the customers must pick a date range and customer can book their rooms. Customer can cancel their bookings and Admin can add, update details and remove rooms from the database. Admin can view a summary of total bookings,  total cancel bookings, and total income in the dashboard.  There is a middleware to upload images to web applications. It is the same as the Event Booking Management System, Food and Beverage Management System, and Order Management System. In the Customer Management System customers can give reviews about the hotel and they can edit it. Login and registration activities and profile management are included. In the Employee Management System, the admin can add employees and edit the details of employees. in the Utility Bill Management System admin can add bills and their expenses all the bills and expenses are calculated in the admin section. Inventory Management System can add inventories and do crud operations. In the all of the management systems have search options and filter options and specialy they include report generations. </p></br>
